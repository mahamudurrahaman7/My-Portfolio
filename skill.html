            <h3 >Background</h3><br>

            <p> 
                I’m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Southeast University.<br><br>
                
                Throughout my studies, I’ve built a strong foundation in software development, problem-solving, 
                and emerging technologies. I’m passionate about applying these skills to real-world projects and 
                constantly expanding my knowledge. I have completed several projects using Java with the Spring MVC and Spring Boot frameworks. <br><br>
                

            </p> <br>

            <h3 >Skills</h3> <br>

            <p> I have strong proficiency in Java and its frameworks like JavaFX and Spring, 
                which helps me build efficient and scalable applications. 
                I enjoy solving complex problems by approaching them methodically and finding practical solutions.<br><br>

                I’m experienced in working with databases, particularly MySQL, ensuring smooth data management and 
                system optimization. On the front-end side, I’m skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with 
                frameworks like AngularJS, React, and Bootstrap, allowing me to create responsive and user-friendly 
                interfaces. <br><br>

                
                I’m also familiar with building RESTful APIs, working with microservices, and using version control 
                tools like Git. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with cloud platforms such as AWS and
                 containerization tools like Docker, making deployment and application management more efficient.<br><br>
                
                I’m always eager to learn new technologies and stay updated with industry best practices,
                 which helps me continuously improve and deliver high-quality software solutions.<br><br>
            </p> <br>

            <h3 >Interest</h3> <br>

            <p> 
                I have a strong passion for software development, particularly in Java and its frameworks. <br><br>
                 
                 In my free time, I enjoy competitive programming. I am a big fan of European club football.
                 I also love to travel.
